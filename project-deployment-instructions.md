# Deploying Your Project! 

Now that you're about finished with your Unit 5 Project, it's time to deploy it for the world to see! Deploying just means making a are website available to users! We can deploy your Unit 5 Projects using Github Pages.

Following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site) to publish your website on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

> ðŸ’¡ Note: Your source should be your `main` or `master` branch. And you will need to have an `index.html` file at the root folder of your repo for your website to deploy properly. 

**One person from each group should submit the URL of your site on Canvas!**
