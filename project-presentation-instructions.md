# Project Presentations

At the end of Project Week, you'll be presenting a professional deck of your project as well as demo your game.

Your Presentation must include:

* Engaging Introduction
* What you built
* Why you built it
* How you built it (technologies)
* Challenge you faced + what you learned (each person has their own two slide)
* Project Demo 
* Q&A (Closing)
 

You can reference this [Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IHbS3labkwV088TnPLN6tjRjGIze9YMKhjb64R6Q8lY/edit#slide=id.g12cc92970b2_1_93) to get started.

**Only one person in the group needs to submit a link to your Google Slides. Make sure you enable sharing with anyone with the link.**
