# Proposal and Wireframe

The proposal and wireframe is where you will document your grand plans. Spend time making these documents highly detailed. Your efforts now will surely pay off in the future. A well crafted project proposal can be as beautiful to look at as the project itself!

To give you inspiration, [here is an example for a simple Bouncing Box game](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubnnmUoDmL8dRnHEKmAzpGwQTPHUW-R7dZt6pVjNSBc/edit#)

## Proposal

Your proposal must include four sections with further details below: 
1. User story / gameplay
    - Describe the gameplay
    - What are the conditions when the game begins?
    - Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?
2. A description of the visual game components 
    - What are the visual game components? Which are static and which are animated?
3. The major data values used in the game
    - What data will you need to track for each game component?
    - What data will you need to track for the entire game?
4. High level descriptions of the user events and timer logic 
    - What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)
    - How do those events affect the data of the program?
    - For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!

## Wire Frame

Your wireframe is where you will put to paper the ideas you have in your mind. Get creative here but make sure that you are meeting the bare minimum requirements.

- Different ways to wireframe
    - Use Google jamboard
    - Use google docs drawings/slideshows
    - White Board/Pen & Paper and take pictures
    - Figma
- Requirements
    - Bare minimum:
        - 3 In-game states shown (start state, mid game state, end state)
        - All visual elements are shown
        - Key of the visual elements describing their purpose
        - Animated elements have some indication of how they are animated (arrows showing movement or brief descriptions are fine)
    - Above and beyond:
        - separate UI for start and end game pages
        - clear design choices

Here are some examples of wireframes from previous cohorts using Figma
